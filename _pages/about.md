Oh, hello there!

Name’s Stephen! I love leveraging data to make *cool stuff™* (or at least stuff that I think is cool)! This website exists to document some of my projects, as well as to share thoughts and more that may be interesting to others.

I am a data professional with a passion for analytics, software development, and leveraging data to address the root cause of business problems. My professional experience includes time in data engineering, data analytics, software design/development, cyber security, project management, and more.

I am also a licensed Professional Engineer, having obtained a degree in industrial engineering from the University of Toronto. The bulk of my degree was focused in software design, mathematical optimization, and data science.

More importantly, my personal interests cover a wide gamut – from data infrastructure to cycling, from home automation to perfecting the simple cup of coffee, and far beyond.

I’m currently most drawn to the crossroads of data engineering and visualization. Namely, combining these with the world of sports to create interesting tools to draw insights from the plethora of professional sports data available to the public.

I’m a strong believer that anyone can create. Don’t let your education define what you can do. Want to learn about the hottest tech in data science? Or how to paint like Picasso? Go for it! Formal education provides a set of tools for your toolbox, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t keep adding more in other ways. So go experiment, have fun, and most importantly, **always** keep learning and creating!

Want to connect with feedback, questions, suggestions for future works, or anything else? You can reach me at [stephen@gidge.dev](mailto:stephen@gidge.dev). Let's make great things together!
