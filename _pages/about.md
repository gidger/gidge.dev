Hey there!

Name's Stephen. I have a passion for making cool stuff (or at least stuff that I think is cool)! This website exists to document some of my projects, as well as to share thoughts and more that may be interesting to others.

My formal training lie in industial engineering, with a focus in optimization and analytics. More importantly, my passions cover a wide gamut, from electronics and home automation, to music and making the perfect cup of coffee, and far beyond.

I'm a strong believe that anyone can create. Don't let your education define what you can do. Want to learn about the newest tech in data engineering? Or how paint like the pros? Go for it! Formal education provides a set of tools for your personal toolbox, but that doesn't mean that tools can't be added in other ways. So go experiment, have fun, and most importantly, always keep learning and creating.

Want to contact me with feedback, questions, suggestions for future works, or anything else? You can reach me at [stephen@gidge.dev](mailto:stephen@gidge.dev). Let's make great things together.

\- Stephen
