Quick update, the Raspberry Pi LED Matrix now supports the PWHL! All features from the NHL & NBA are fully supported. Live scores, next game for your favourite team, and standings.

That's it, that's the update.

Here's a video of it in action, as well as some additional screenshots.

Next up is implemented the WNBA and MLB. WNBA implementation is actually 99% complete already, but we'll need to see if the 2026 season even happens before I release it...

You can view all the code for this project, along with installation instructions, at my GitHub Repository [here](https://github.com/gidger/rpi-led-sports-scoreboard).
